        <h2>FEU Roosevelt Halloween Cos-Play and Lobby Decoration</h2>
        <p>A fun-filled day of costumes, decorations, and campus activities.</p>
        <p>Our Halloween cosplay experience was honestly so fun! Planning what to wear was a blast! we brainstormed, laughed, 
            and got really into it. But the real shock came when we saw the costumes the other students wore, some were wild, 
            creative, and even scary! When the moment came, we were called up one by one to show off our characters, and it felt 
            like stepping into a whole other world. It was such a cool experience to see everyone’s ideas come to life!</p>

        <h2>Sinag Tams Activities</h2>

        <p>The Sinag Tamaraw Concert was such a great experience! Having bands perform at our school made the whole atmosphere 
            feel so wholesome and energetic. Everyone was genuinely having fun, and to top it all off, there was an amazing 
            fireworks show at the end. It was definitely a night to remember.
            
            As for Sinag Sports, it was just as fun! There were tons of booths to explore, and watching the players give it 
            their all was so exciting. I especially loved the volleyball games, even though we didn’t win as champions. 
            It was a little disappointing, but in the end, they still played well and can use this experience to get even better. 
            All in all, it was a really fun and memorable event!</p>
